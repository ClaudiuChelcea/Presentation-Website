This is a simple CV presentation website developed in HTML & CSS & Python.

The server side was implemented using Python's framework Flask and the webpages were build with
HTML & CSS and bootstrap.

The website also features a functioning contact form that will send me an email with
the given input from the form.

For privacy reasons, the login information from the code, file: main.py, lines 15-16
are placed as dummy_gmail@gmail.com and dummy_gmail_password.
For the form to work correctly, you have to change those lines with an actual gmail account.

The email structure will be as follows:

Name: <name_completed_in_the_form>
Company: <company_completed_in_the_form>
Email: <email_completed_in_the_form>
Phone number: <phone_number_completed_in_the_form>

Contact reason: <contact_reason_completed_in_the_form>
Message: <message_completed_in_the_form>
